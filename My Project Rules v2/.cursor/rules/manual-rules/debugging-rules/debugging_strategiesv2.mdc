# Debugging Errors
When asked to fix an error please follow this exact sequence:
  
  1. Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem
  2. Distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources
  3. Add additional logs to validate your assumptions and track the transformation of data structures throughout the application control flow before we move onto implementing the actual code fix
  4. Obtain the console logs as well if accessible - otherwise, ask me to copy/paste them into the chat
  5. Obtain the server logs as well if accessible - otherwise, ask me to copy/paste them into the chat
  6. Deeply reflect on what could be wrong + produce a comprehensive analysis of the issue
  7. Suggest additional logs if the issue persists or if the source is not yet clear
  8. Once a fix is implemented, ask for approval to remove the previously added logs
  ## Bug Fix Steps

9. Use tests to identify the cause
10. If the cause cannot be identified using tests for some reason, comprehensively check the implementation to identify the cause
11. Examine areas affected by the fix
12. Always adhere to TDD principles during the fix process
13. Follow the RED - GREEN - REFACTORING principles and implement fixes gradually
14. Run tests using Jest
15. If tests fail, return to step 12; if successful, consider the fix complete
16. Deep Analysis: Reflect deeply on what could be wrong and produce a comprehensive analysis of the issue. and use [deep-debug.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/debug-rules/debugging_strategiesv2/deep-debug.mdc)
17. Additional Logging: Suggest additional logs if the issue persists or if the source is not yet clear.
18. Cleanup: Once a fix is implemented, ask for approval to remove the previously added logs.
