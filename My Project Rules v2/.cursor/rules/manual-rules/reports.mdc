Progress reports are the central documents for tracking all aspects of project progress. These files MUST be maintained throughout the project lifecycle. They are stored in `docs/reports` if the folders are not create then create them.. 

CRITICAL: BEFORE adding any dates, use terminal `date` command to get the current date.

### 1.1. CRITICAL: Information Preservation
- **NEVER delete historical information** - this is the most important rule
- Add new information rather than replacing existing content
- Even if we change course, it's important to have a record of our reasoning
- Never delete completed tasks or phase summaries, even if they seem outdated
- When updating task status, modify the existing entries instead of removing them
- Maintain the complete chronological history of all project phases

### 1.2. Organization Structure
- Use consistent milestone naming across projects
- When adding new entries, place them in appropriate sections
- Use consistent formatting for all progress entries
- Include specific dates and clear task descriptions
- Cross-reference related tasks between sections when applicable

### 1.3. Tracking Changes
- Always explain plan deviations rather than hiding them
- Document the rationale for changes
- Track both planned and completed work
- Separate concerns by appropriate categorization

### 1.4. Maintenance Requirements
- These reports serve as the single source of truth for project history and status
- Update after each significant development
- Review before beginning any new implementation work
- Update immediately after completing any task

### 1.5. Standard Progress Documentation Format

#### 1.5.1. Implementation Status
- Track by phase with detailed task status
- Include task name, status, dates, and notes
- Maintain phase summaries
- Use standard status terms (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked)
- Always keep previous phase information intact, even when starting a new phase

#### 1.5.2. Error Log
- Document errors with description, root cause, solution, and prevention
- Include date and context for each error
- Link errors to specific tasks when relevant

#### 1.5.3. Design Decisions
- Record context, options considered, final decision, rationale, and implications
- Number decisions sequentially for easy reference
- Include date and participants in the decision

#### 1.5.4. Technical Insights
- Document performance considerations
- Note dependencies and their versions
- Document edge cases and their handling
- Record limitations and constraints

#### 1.5.5. Plan Deviations
- Document original plan vs. actual implementation
- Explain reasons for deviations
- Assess impact on timeline and deliverables
- Note lessons learned

#### 1.5.6. Future Improvements
- List potential enhancements
- Document technical debt
- Prioritize future work items
- Include rationale for deferring improvements
