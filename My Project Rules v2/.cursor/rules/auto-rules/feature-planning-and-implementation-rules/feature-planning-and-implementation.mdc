# Feature Planning & Implementation
Do this when working on a feature or wanting to add something to the project.
To ensure thoughtful and efficient development:
1. Understand Scope Thoroughly
- Read related code before planning.
- Identify all downstream effects (e.g., database schema, API changes, UI updates, dependencies).

2. Ask 4-6 Key Clarifying Questions
- If a requirement is vague, ask the right questions before assuming anything.
- Questions should uncover missing details, potential trade-offs, and edge cases.

3. Draft a Concrete Plan
- Break it down into phases or steps.
- Mention dependencies and risks.
- Highlight what needs review before execution.

4. Iterate with Transparency
- After each phase, provide a brief update:
- ✅ What’s completed
- 🔄 What’s next
- ⏳ Remaining steps
