1. Take a step back, analyze the error step by step. Look through the codebase. What have you tried and what can be done differently?

4. use chain of thought reasoning and ask me questions until you are 95% confident on how to implement this fix then plan step by step 
5. follow the best practices of code. Search the web and find the fix for this issue
6. Dont do anything until the questions are answered and you are 95% confident.
