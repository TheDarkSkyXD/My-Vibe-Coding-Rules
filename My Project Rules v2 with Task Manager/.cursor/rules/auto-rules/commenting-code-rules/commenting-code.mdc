# Commenting Rules

## Core Principles

- Documentation should be clear and concise
- Keep documentation close to the code it describes
- Update documentation when code changes
- Focus on explaining "why" more than "how"

## Code Comments

- Write brief, clear comments
- Focus on explaining why, not what
- Keep comments up to date with code
- Remove commented-out code
- Use JSDoc for public APIs and interfaces
