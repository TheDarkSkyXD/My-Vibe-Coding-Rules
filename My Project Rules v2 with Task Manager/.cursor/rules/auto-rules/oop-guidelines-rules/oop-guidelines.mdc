# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Guidelines

When generating or modifying code, follow these Object-Oriented Programming principles to create modular, maintainable applications with multiple connected files instead of monolithic code.

## Core Principles

1. **Separate Concerns with Classes**
   - Create distinct classes for different responsibilities
   - Each class should have a single purpose
   - Avoid monolithic files with multiple unrelated functionalities

2. **Structure Like Lego Blocks**
   - Design classes to be modular and reusable
   - Create clear interfaces between components
   - Use composition and inheritance appropriately

3. **File Organization**
   - Place each class in its own file
   - Group related classes in appropriate directories
   - Follow naming conventions that reflect class purposes
