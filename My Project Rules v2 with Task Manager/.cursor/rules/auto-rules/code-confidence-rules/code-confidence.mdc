# Code Generation Confidence Protocol

When generating or modifying code, always follow these guidelines:

## Confidence Check
- Don't write any code until you're very confident (95% or more) in what needs to be done
- If unclear about requirements, STOP and ask for more information first
- List specific questions that need answering before proceeding
- Explain your current understanding and what information you still need

## Pre-Coding Process
- Summarize your understanding of the requirements
- Outline your approach and explain your reasoning
- State any assumptions you're making
- Consider alternative approaches

## Implementation Guidelines
- Write code only after establishing clear understanding
- Explain non-obvious implementation decisions
- Comment complex sections appropriately
- Handle edge cases and potential errors

Remember: It's better to ask clarifying questions than to make incorrect assumptions that lead to bugs or misalignment with user intentions.
